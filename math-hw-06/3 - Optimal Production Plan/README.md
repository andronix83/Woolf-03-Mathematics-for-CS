# Task 3: Optimal Production Plan Analysis

## 1. Problem Overview
The goal was to determine the optimal number of chairs ($x$) and tables ($y$) to produce in order to maximize profit, given constraints on wood and labor resources.

## 2. Optimal Strategy
Based on the linear programming calculation, the optimal production plan is:
- **Chairs:** 15.0 units
- **Tables:** 22.5 units

**Total Projected Profit:** 25,500.00 UAH

## 3. Resource Utilization Analysis
We analyzed the consumption of resources at this optimal production level:

### Wood
- **Available:** 120 $m^2$
- **Used:** 120.0 $m^2$
- **Status:** **Fully Utilized** (0 $m^2$ remaining).
- **Conclusion:** Wood is a binding constraint. Increasing wood stocks would likely allow for higher production and profit.

### Labor Hours
- **Available:** 90 hours
- **Used:** 90.0 hours
- **Status:** **Fully Utilized** (0 hours remaining).
- **Conclusion:** Labor is also a binding constraint. The optimal point lies at the intersection of both resource limits.

## 4. Conclusion
The factory achieves maximum efficiency by fully utilizing both wood and labor resources. To increase profit further, the factory would need to acquire **both** additional wood and additional labor hours, as currently, neither resource has any slack.

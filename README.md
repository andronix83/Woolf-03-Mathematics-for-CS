# Woolf — Mathematics for CS (Module 03)

A lightweight index of the nested folders in this module to make navigation on GitHub easier.
Replace or extend the entries below to match the actual folders in this directory.

## Quick navigation
- [01-Calculus-Basics](./01-Calculus-Basics/) — Captions: Limits, Derivatives, Integrals (intro examples and notes).
- [02-Linear-Algebra](./02-Linear-Algebra/) — Captions: Vectors, Matrices, Eigenvalues (notation and exercises).
- [03-Probability-and-Statistics](./03-Probability-and-Statistics/) — Captions: Distributions, Expectation, Hypothesis testing.
- [04-Discrete-Math](./04-Discrete-Math/) — Captions: Logic, Sets, Graph theory (proof sketches and problems).
- [examples](./examples/) — Captions: runnable snippets, Jupyter notebooks, and sample solutions.
- [notes](./notes/) — Captions: lecture notes, summaries, and references.

## How to extend
- Add a new folder to this directory.
- Edit this README and add a new bullet using the pattern:
  - `[Folder-Name](./Folder-Name/) — Short caption describing contents.`
- GitHub will automatically turn the link into a clickable directory link.

## Notes
- If a linked folder contains an `README.md`, GitHub will show that README when the folder is opened.
- Keep captions short (one line) so the index stays scannable.
